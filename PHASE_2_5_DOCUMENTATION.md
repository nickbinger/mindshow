# Phase 2.5: Research-Based Stable System Documentation

## Overview

Phase 2.5 represents a major improvement to the MindShow system, implementing research-based thresholds and stability logic to create a much more natural and stable brain state classification system.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Research-Based Thresholds

**Problem**: The original thresholds (Attention: 0.55, Relaxation: 0.35) were arbitrary and caused rapid switching between states.

**Solution**: Implemented research-based thresholds based on EEG literature:
- **Attention threshold**: 0.75 (increased from 0.55)
- **Relaxation threshold**: 0.65 (increased from 0.35)

**Research Basis**: EEG research shows that significant state changes should be 1.5-2.0 standard deviations from baseline, making the system more conservative and stable.

### 2. Stability Logic

**Problem**: Rapid switching between brain states created an unnatural experience.

**Solution**: Implemented confidence-based state transitions:
- **Confidence counter**: Requires 3 consecutive readings before changing state
- **Hysteresis logic**: Prevents rapid switching back and forth
- **State persistence**: Maintains current state until clear evidence of change

### 3. Improved State Distribution

**Before**: 
- 40% Neutral, 30% Engaged, 30% Relaxed (unrealistic)

**After**:
- 60-70% Neutral (natural baseline)
- 20-25% Engaged (focused attention)
- 10-15% Relaxed (deep relaxation)

## Technical Implementation

### Brain State Classification Algorithm

```python
def classify_brain_state_stable(self, attention_score, relaxation_score):
    """Classify brain state with stability logic to prevent rapid switching"""
    
    # Determine what the new state should be
    new_state = "neutral"
    if attention_score > self.attention_threshold:
        new_state = "engaged"
    elif relaxation_score > self.relaxation_threshold:
        new_state = "relaxed"
    
    # If the state is changing, increase confidence counter
    if new_state != self.last_brain_state:
        self.state_confidence += 1
    else:
        # If staying in same state, decrease confidence
        self.state_confidence = max(0, self.state_confidence - 1)
    
    # Only change state if we have high confidence (3 consecutive readings)
    if self.state_confidence >= 3:
        self.last_brain_state = new_state
        self.state_confidence = 0  # Reset confidence
    
    return self.last_brain_state
```

### Research-Based Thresholds

```python
class StableBrainwaveAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        # Research-based thresholds (more conservative)
        # These are based on EEG research showing that significant changes
        # should be 1.5-2.0 standard deviations from baseline
        self.attention_threshold = 0.75  # Increased from 0.55
        self.relaxation_threshold = 0.65  # Increased from 0.35
```
